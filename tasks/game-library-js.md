## 1. Full Game Engines / Frameworks (2D & 3D)

- **Phaser.js** – 2D game framework with scenes, physics, input, tilemaps.
- **Kaboom.js** – Lightweight 2D game library for quick prototyping.
- **Pixi.js** – 2D WebGL renderer (graphics-focused, can integrate with physics engines).
- **Three.js** – 3D rendering library for WebGL.
- **PlayCanvas** – 3D browser game engine with physics and editor.
- **Babylon.js** – 3D game engine for WebGL with physics support.
- **MelonJS** – Lightweight 2D HTML5 game engine.

## 2. Physics Libraries

- **Matter.js** – 2D rigid body physics engine.
- **Planck.js** – 2D physics engine (Box2D port).
- **p2.js** – 2D physics engine (used in Phaser 2).
- **Cannon.js** – 3D physics engine for rigid body physics.
- **Ammo.js** – 3D physics engine (Bullet physics port).

## 5. UI / RPG / Strategy Helpers

- **RexPlugins (for Phaser)** – Extra plugins: grid, camera, UI, pathfinding.
- **phaser3-plugin-isometric** – For isometric games.
- **Crafty.js** – Entity-component system for 2D games.
- **Impact.js** – Commercial 2D game engine.

---

## 6. Specialized / Lightweight Libraries

- **Kaboom.js** – Minimalist 2D game dev.
- **GDevelop** – No-code/low-code game engine (JS export).
- **Enchant.js** – Simple 2D engine for beginners.
- **PIXI + Matter.js combo** – High-performance 2D games with custom physics.

---

## 7. Mobile / Hybrid Integration

- **Cordova + Phaser** – Convert Phaser games to mobile apps.
- **Capacitor + Phaser** – Modern alternative for mobile deployment.
- **React Native + Three.js / Pixi.js** – Embed 3D/2D games in apps.
